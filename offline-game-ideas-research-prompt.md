# Offline Game Ideas Research Prompt

I want you to act as a startup game product researcher and indie game designer.
Your task is to propose exactly 5 offline-first game ideas that are easy to build, have potential for high adoption, and are realistic for a small team or solo developer.

## Requirements

- Target audience: casual mobile/desktop players.
- Constraint: game must work fully offline (no mandatory backend).
- Build scope: MVP should be buildable in 4–8 weeks by 1–3 developers.
- Prefer genres with proven retention/adoption patterns.
- Focus on ideas with simple core loops and low art/tech complexity.

## For each of the 5 ideas, provide

1. Concept summary (what the game is in 2–3 sentences)
2. Why it could have high adoption (market logic + player psychology)
3. Similar successful games and what they prove
4. MVP scope:
   - Core mechanics (must-have)
   - Content needed for launch (levels, characters, modes, etc.)
   - UI/screens needed
   - Tech stack recommendation (engine + tools)
   - Team roles needed
   - Development timeline by week
5. Monetization options that still fit offline play
6. Go-to-market test plan (small, low-budget validation strategy)
7. Main risks and mitigations
8. Success metrics for first 30 days after launch

## Research quality requirements

- Base your analysis on strong evidence from publicly available sources.
- Include a short “evidence note” per idea with concrete data points (genre trends, comparable game downloads/revenue estimates, retention benchmarks, store trends).
- Provide source links for every major claim.
- If exact numbers are uncertain, clearly label them as estimates and explain assumptions.
- Prefer sources from the last 2–3 years where possible.

## Output format

- Start with a ranked shortlist table (rank, game idea, estimated MVP difficulty, adoption potential, why).
- Then provide full details for each idea.
- End with a final recommendation: best idea to build first and why.
- Be concise but specific, and avoid vague generic advice.
